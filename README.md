# Image_Classifier_CNN_Data_Augmentation

## Project Description
This project focuses on developing and optimizing a multi-class image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project incorporates key deep learning techniques, such as data augmentation (random flip, rotation, and crop), batch normalization, and ReLU activation, to enhance the modelâ€™s performance. The final model achieved a test accuracy of 76.86%, demonstrating significant improvement over the baseline.
